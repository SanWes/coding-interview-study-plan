# Strings

## Overview
A **string** is a sequence of characters. Strings are widely used in coding problems and often come with various operations and algorithmic challenges.

### Key Concepts

- **Immutability**: In many languages (like Python), strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change individual characters directly.
- **String Length**: Most languages provide a method to get the length of a string in `O(1)` time.
- **Substring Search**: Checking for a substring inside a string, often using algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt or Boyer-Moore.

### Common Operations
1. **Concatenation**: Combine two strings. 
2. **Substring**: Extract a portion of a string.
3. **Searching**: Find a substring within a string.
4. **Reversing**: Reverse the characters of a string.
5. **Comparison**: Compare two strings lexicographically.

### Important Algorithms

- **Sliding window technique**: Used for problems like finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)**: A substring search algorithm with linear time complexity.

### Common String Problems
1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
2. **Reverse a String**
3. **Valid Anagram**
4. **Palindrome Check**
5. **String Compression**

### Time Complexity
- **Access**: O(1)
- **Search**: O(n)
- **Substring Extraction**: O(n)
- **Comparison**: O(n)
