## Approach

### Study Plan

The study plan is designed to cover essential topics over 12 weeks, with the first 4 weeks focusing on topical study and the last 8 weeks focusing on in-depth practice.

### Week 1 - 4: Topical Study + Practice
During the first four weeks, you will learn key topics in depth. Each week, you will focus on a few major topics and work through practice questions. Here are the core topics for Week 1:

1. **Arrays**
2. **Strings**
3. **Hash Tables**
4. **Recursion**

Refer to the corresponding markdown files in the `Week_1/` directory for detailed explanations, resources, and practice problems.

### Week 5 - 12: In-depth Practice
After completing the initial study, the following weeks will focus on practicing problems from a variety of topics. The problems are designed to enhance your problem-solving skills and are categorized by difficulty.

Refer to the `Week_5-12/Practice_Questions.md` for a list of problems to solve each week.

## Resources

The `resources/` folder contains cheatsheets for important topics like arrays, sorting, and dynamic programming. These are helpful for quick references as you study.

### Quick Reference
